configuration: module vs standalone component. Makes it easier (then implement the auto later once it works)

SHOULD BE PRETTY SIMPLE MY BOY
Module conf:

- go to module
- Once in the file method:

- standalone component conf:
- go to component:
  - Once in the file method:

Once in the file method:

- find the import statement
  - found: check for empty:
    - empty: add the import with the `[]`, reposition the cursor in there
    - non empty: find the last ] of the import, add `, $]` and set the cursor in there

AUTO Conf

- Check if there is a module file in the folder
  - if there is check if there is an import statement
  - If YES: check if the import is empty.
  - if yes is just position the cursor there
  - if not replace the last ] with ',]' save the positiuon and put the cursor there.
  - If not: Check the component for the same file name for
  - Check the component file, for a standalone true decorator.
    - Check for import empty
      - if yes is just position the cursor there
      - if not replace the last ] with ',]' save the positiuon and put
